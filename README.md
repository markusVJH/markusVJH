Hello,

my name is Markus and I'm a Finnish guy hoping to become a full time programmer. 
In January 2023 I began studying full stack web development at [Business College Helsinki](https://en.bc.fi/qualifications/full-stack-web-developer-program/) to pursue this goal.

I am looking for an internship!

#

Currently focusing on TypeScript, Next.js, Drupal and more
